<p>This is an app I created to help users find locally made food and farmers markets.</p>

Some main features of this app would be:
<p>Users can add known locations as well as browse locations others have added.</p> 
<p>I employeed Google Maps API and Geolocater Gem to find users locations.</p> 
<p>I am working on creating profile pages for food producers as well as better usablitly for users to search locations.</p> 

<p>This app is a work in progress but please feel free to file an issue if you feel something needs to be changed.</p>

<p>To get this site up and running you fist need to install Rails. Here is a site that will walk you through the process step by step: http://installrails.com/</p>

<p>In the terminal navigate to the file directory and run rails s to start the server. Visit the app by typing "localhost:3000" in your web browser.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for checking it out! </p>
